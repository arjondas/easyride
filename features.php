	<p style="margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;">EasyRide is based on the questioning the existing rental systems and considering the services they offer. We improvised a service that is modern in nature through rendering online services to rent cars and a very fast process. After creating an account its matter of time before you get you hands onto a new car. We focused on fast service time and creating innovative steps so that you get what you want.<br><br>
	
	It's a demand of time to create new ways for people to access transportation mediums easily. As internet has been very effective to simplify the way of living , an web based application to find suitable vehicles for our transportation will of great help. 

To make such an application a systematic way has to be followed. Such as making a logical design for the system , representing the design clearly through diagram , mapping etc. Then comes describing the system part by part so that it becomes easier to find ways of implementation.The implementation is a very important part which brings an idea into reality and makes it available for people to use. 

Then comes the part where the users have  to be made aware of the rules or regulations for using this application. Users should be advised on how to use this application so that they can use it for their benefits which is the actual reason for the whole project.

There are ways in which this app can be developed. It may be expanded according to the demands of people and time. This will be done by taking the feedbacks from the users and their recommendations.  

This app will make peoples' daily life a lot easier by creating a path which anyone can use any time of the day even when sitting in their residence for hiring transportations.<br><br>
	Our lifestyle has changed drastically with the progression of time. A lot has been invented to put our daily life at ease. People are used to get what they need very quickly. But hiring vehicles has been something where people get uncomfortable , whether they will get the right car with perfect accommodation, speed, fuel economy etc. Then there's price and in some cases driver for the vehicle which is very hard to manage. As a solution of the problem an internet  application comes first of all in our mind. It's a place where all those details of hiring a transportation can be combined together so that people can get all the information they want. And use of internet has spread widely enough for people to access this application easily. This will save a lot of time. People can hire any kind of vehicles and driver if they want. There will be no uncertainty as everything is transparent and records will be kept. 

This will help people a great deal to simplify the arrangement of transportation. Our project is meant to meet the problems described above. This kind of application will work as a package which people can use to avoid the physical and mental stress of doing it manually. This will save a lot of time and people will be able to have pleasant stress free journey.</p>
